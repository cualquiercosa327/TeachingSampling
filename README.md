# TeachingSampling
### An R package that draws complex samples and estimates complex parameters

This is the version control site for the `TeachingSampling` package. This software allows you to select samples from the most common (but somehow complex) sampling schemes. Along with this feature, the software allows you to estimate parameters such as totals, means, ratios, coefficient regressions, percentiles, medians, etc. 

The software is based on the book written by the author of the package.
